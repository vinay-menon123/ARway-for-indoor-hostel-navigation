# ARway-for-indoor-hostel-navigation
This repository contains the usage of ARwayKitSDK v2.0 to create an indoor navigation for VIT Chennai A-Block boys hostel. The navigation contains location markers to all the rooms in a floor. The navigation is localised to the particular floor the user is present in.

--> NOTE: You will need an subscription of ARwayKitSDK v2.0 to replicate this project. You can visit their website for the same.

--> NOTE: The apps will only work in VIT Chennai A-block boys hostel.
